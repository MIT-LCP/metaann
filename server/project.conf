## Metaann project configuration file (format version 0.3)
##
## This is the main configuration file defining settings for a metaann
## project.  You will probably need to make some changes to these
## settings (particularly the Database section) depending on the
## nature of your project.
##
## Within this file, the following variables can be used:
##
##  @PROJECT@          URL of this PhysioNetWorks project
##                      (e.g. https://physionet.org/works/Foo)
##
##  @PHYSIOBANK@       URL of the PhysioBank top-level directory
##                      (http://physionet.org/physiobank/database)
##
##  @PROJECT_SERVER@   URL of the metaann server for this project
##                      (e.g. https://physionet.org/pnw/a/maserver?project=Foo)
##
##  @MASERVER@         URL of the metaann server, without options
##                      (https://physionet.org/pnw/a/maserver)

Version = 0.3

################################################################
## The [Database] section defines the set of events that will be
## displayed to reviewers.
[Database]
## [Database]/DBPath:
##   Database path (a space-separated list of URLs where records are
##   located.)  By default this includes the top-level directory of
##   your project (@PROJECT@/files) as well as the top-level directory
##   of PhysioBank (@PHYSIOBANK@).
DBPath         = @PROJECT@/files @PHYSIOBANK@

## [Database]/RecordList:
##   URL of the list of records.  Normally this should be set to
##   "@PROJECT_SERVER@&a=records" (which will generate a randomly
##   shuffled list of records for each user.)  Alternatively, you can
##   set this to the URL of a text file within your project,
##   e.g. "@PROJECT@/files/records" (in which case all users will see
##   records in the same order.)  Each record in this file must be
##   located in one of the directories listed in DBPath.
RecordList     = @PROJECT_SERVER@&a=records

## [Database]/Annotator:
##   Name of the WFDB annotator containing the events to be reviewed.
##   Each record listed in the RecordList file must include an
##   annotation file of this type.
Annotator      = alarms

## [Database]/AnnotationType, AnnotationSubtype, AnnotationNum,
## AnnotationChan, AnnotationAux:
##   These options determine which events (among all of the events in
##   the source annotation file) are to be presented to reviewers.  If
##   none of these options are set, all events in the the source
##   annotation file will be shown.  AnnotationType is the numeric
##   annotation code (e.g., 22 for NOTE).  'AnnotationAux', if
##   specified, must match the beginning of the 'aux' string.
AnnotationType      = 22
#AnnotationSubtype  = 0
#AnnotationNum      = 0
#AnnotationChan     = 0
#AnnotationAux      = *

## [Database]/DBCalFile:
##   URL of the calibration file.  By default this is set to
##   @PROJECT_SERVER@&a=dbcal.
DBCalFile      = @PROJECT_SERVER@&a=dbcal


################################################################
## The [Responses] section defines the possible responses that a
## user may submit for each event.
[Responses]

## [Responses]/InterfaceXML:
##   URL of the GTK+ user interface definition file.  This file should
##   be created using Glade (version 3.8.x, for GTK+ 2.24).  The
##   interface can be arranged in any way you like, but must include
##   the following specific widgets:
##     options_box:      Top-level container (e.g. a GtkVBox or GtkTable)
##     comment_entry:    GtkTextView or GtkEntry for users to enter comments
##     <XXX>_button:     GtkToggleButton for response code <XXX>
##                       (users click this button to submit a response)
##     <XXX>_info_label: GtkLabel for response code <XXX>
##                       (blank by default; in adjudication mode,
##                       shows which responses were chosen by
##                       reviewers)
InterfaceXML = @PROJECT_SERVER@&a=gtkui

## [Responses]/NumResponses:
##   Number of possible responses.
NumResponses = 3

## [Responses]/Response<N>:
##   Response identifier.  This is used to associate a response with a
##   button defined in the InterfaceXML file.
##
## [Responses]/Response<N>.Status:
##   "Status" value for the response.  Two responses are considered to
##   "disagree" (thus requiring adjudication) if they have different
##   status values.
##
## [Responses]/Response<N>.Substatus:
##   "Substatus" value for the response.  This can be used to
##   distinguish two responses without triggering adjudication.
##
## [Responses]/Response<N>.CommentRequired:
##   If set to "true", users will be prompted to enter a comment when
##   choosing this response.  (Comments are always permitted, and
##   users can press the "Next" button if they really don't want to
##   enter a comment, but this can be a useful hint.)
##
## [Responses]/Response<N>.AlwaysAdjudicate:
##   If set to "true", events for which multiple reviewers choose this
##   response will still be adjudicated (even if they all agree), and
##   adjudicators themselves will not be allowed to select this
##   response.
##
## [Responses]/Response<N>.NeverAdjudicate:
##   If set to "true", events for which any reviewer chooses this
##   response will never be adjudicated (even if other reviewers
##   disagree.)
