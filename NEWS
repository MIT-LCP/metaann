Version 0.4

 * After logging in, metaann now retrieves a list of active projects
   from the web server and lets you select one.

 * Adjudication mode is now working (it was previously implemented in
   edit-alarms, the predecessor to metaann, but was incomplete in
   metaann 0.3.)  You can select adjudication mode from the project
   selection dialog, if the project administrator has enabled it.

 * Very small time scales are not listed in the menu, in order to
   prevent you from selecting them accidentally (and thus requiring
   metaann to download a correspondingly huge section of the waveform
   data.)  By default, time scales smaller than 125 mm/min will not be
   shown; this can be controlled by the project configuration.

 * The list of records is shown as a combo box so you can jump back to
   a previous record, or get an idea of your overall progress.  An
   open circle is shown next for each record that you have partially
   annotated; a filled circle is shown for each record that you have
   fully annotated.  Likewise, the list of alarms for the current
   record is shown as a combo box so that you can jump around within
   the record; a filled circle denotes an alarm you have annotated,
   and an open circle denotes one you have marked as uncertain.
